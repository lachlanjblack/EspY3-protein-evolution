    "# EspY3 flanking-region homologue search\n",
    "## 4/11/25\n",
    "\n",
    "EspY3 has a domain of two pentapeptide repeats (PPRs). This is the only annotated region in Pfam and is conserved across 10,000 proteins. Whilst it is highly conserved and structurally stable, the surrounding flanks evolve more rapidly and often determine function or interactions. Variation in these flanks therefore can signal functional divergence or specialisation among homologous proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of these regions may uncover lineage-specific adaptations and link sequence evolution outside the repeat domain to potential differences in protein function within pathogens. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is a ~40 aa spacer region between PPR1 and PPR2, which I will query incase there is something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I aim to:\n",
    "1. Extract the N- and C-terminal sequences *outside* the PPR domain.\n",
    "2. Search BLASTP with each flanking sequence to find homologues\n",
    "3. Curate hits with CD-HIT to remove redundancy\n",
    "4. Annotate with Pfam/InterPro to see if any new domains appear in the flanks\n",
    "5. Build allignments and trees\n"
